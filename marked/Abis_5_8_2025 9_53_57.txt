    "feedback": "The implementation correctly follows the data science techniques for training a neural network on the MNIST dataset, including data normalization and model evaluation. The code is well-structured and uses appropriate libraries like TensorFlow and scikit-learn. However, it could benefit from additional comments for clarity and better organization of imports."
