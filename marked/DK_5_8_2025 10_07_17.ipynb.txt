Evaluate the student's code as follows:\n\n    1. **Check Relevance**: Determine if the student has submitted the correct assignment (e.g., they might have accidentally uploaded Assignment 2 instead of Assignment 1). Mention this gently if so.\n    2. **Understand Effort**: Acknowledge any correct structures like imports, data preprocessing, or attempts to solve the problem even if the logic isn't fully correct.\n    3. **Suggest Improvements**: Provide 2\u20133 specific suggestions to improve the code (e.g., \u201cyou should use a for loop to iterate over the rows\u201d or \u201cconsider using `groupby()` for aggregation\u201d).\n    4. **Be Encouraging**: Praise things like clear variable names, use of comments, or the correct use of libraries even if the final solution isn\u2019t accurate.\n    5. **Be Honest but Kind**: Don't overpraise. If the work is missing or incorrect, point it out clearly, but respectfully.\n\n    Return your review in **valid JSON format** like this:\n    {\n      \"score\": <integer between 0\u2013100>,\n      \"feedback\": \"<clear, supportive feedback with suggestions>\"\n    }\n\n    Here's the student's submitted code:\n\n    ```python\n    import tensorflow as tf\nfrom tensorflow.keras.datasets import mnist\nfrom tensorflow.keras.utils import to_categorical\n\n# Load data\n(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()\n\n# Normalize\nx_train = x_train / 255.0\nx_test = x_test / 255.0\n\n# Reshape for CNN (28x28x1)\nx_train_cnn = x_train.reshape(-1, 28, 28, 1)\nx_test_cnn = x_test.reshape(-1, 28, 28, 1)\n\n# One-hot encode labels\ny_train_cat = to_categorical(y_train)\ny_test_cat = to_categorical(y_test)\n\n\nfrom tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential\nfrom tensorflow.keras.layers import Flatten, Dense\n\n# ANN model\nann_model = Sequential([\n    Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)),\n    Dense(128, activation='relu'),\n    Dense(64, activation='relu'),\n    Dense(10, activation='softmax')\n])\n\n# Compile\nann_model.compile(optimizer='adam',\n                  loss='categorical_crossentropy',\n                  metrics=['accuracy'])\n\n# Train\nann_history = ann_model.fit(x_train, y_train_cat, epochs=5, validation_split=0.1, verbose=2)\n\n# Evaluate\nann_loss, ann_accuracy = ann_model.evaluate(x_test, y_test_cat)\n\n\nfrom tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense\n\n# CNN model\ncnn_model = Sequential([\n    Conv2D(32, kernel_size=(3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),\n    MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)),\n    Flatten(),\n    Dense(128, activation='relu'),\n    Dense(64, activation='relu'),\n    Dense(10, activation='softmax')\n])\n\n# Compile\ncnn_model.compile(optimizer='adam',\n                  loss='categorical_crossentropy',\n                  metrics=['accuracy'])\n\n# Train\ncnn_history = cnn_model.fit(x_train_cnn, y_train_cat, epochs=5, validation_split=0.1, verbose=2)\n\n# Evaluate\ncnn_loss, cnn_accuracy = cnn_model.evaluate(x_test_cnn, y_test_cat)\n\n\nprint(f\"ANN Accuracy: {ann_accuracy:.4f}, Loss: {ann_loss:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"CNN Accuracy: {cnn_accuracy:.4f}, Loss: {cnn_loss:.4f}\")\n\n\nANN Accuracy: 0.9756, Loss: 0.0834\nCNN Accuracy: 0.9901, Loss: 0.0352\n| Metric        | ANN     | CNN             |\n| ------------- | ------- | --------------- |\n| Test Accuracy | \\~97.5% | \\~99.0%         |\n| Test Loss     | \\~0.08  | \\~0.03          |\n| Training Time | Faster  | Slightly Slower |\n\n    ```\n    ",
    "result": "```json\n{\n  \"score\": 85,\n  \"feedback\": \"Great job on your submission! You've correctly imported the necessary libraries and implemented data preprocessing steps, including normalization and one-hot encoding of labels. Your model architectures for both the ANN and CNN are well-structured, and you\u2019ve clearly printed the results for comparison. However, I noticed that you didn't include a brief report discussing your observations and conclusions, which is a key part of the assignment. Here are a few suggestions for improvement: 1) Consider adding comments to explain the purpose of each model section, which will enhance the readability of your code. 2) You should include a discussion on how the CNN improved classification performance compared to the ANN, as this is crucial for your analysis. 3) Make sure to summarize your findings in a conclusion section to complete your report. Keep up the good work!\"\n}\n```"
