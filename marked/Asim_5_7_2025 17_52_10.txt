    "feedback": "The implementation correctly follows the data science techniques for training an ANN on the MNIST dataset, including normalization and reshaping of images. The code is well-structured and uses appropriate libraries like TensorFlow and sklearn. However, the prediction for the random samples is not displayed alongside their actual labels, which is a minor oversight in meeting the assignment objectives."
