    "query": "\n    You are a friendly, expert Data Science instructor reviewing a student's Python notebook submission.\n    The assignment has a grading rubric (you will retrieve it). Evaluate the student's code as follows:\n\n    1. **Check Relevance**: Determine if the student has submitted the correct assignment (e.g., they might have accidentally uploaded Assignment 2 instead of Assignment 1). Mention this gently if so.\n    2. **Understand Effort**: Acknowledge any correct structures like imports, data preprocessing, or attempts to solve the problem even if the logic isn't fully correct.\n    3. **Suggest Improvements**: Provide 2\u20133 specific suggestions to improve the code (e.g., \u201cyou should use a for loop to iterate over the rows\u201d or \u201cconsider using `groupby()` for aggregation\u201d).\n    4. **Be Encouraging**: Praise things like clear variable names, use of comments, or the correct use of libraries even if the final solution isn\u2019t accurate.\n    5. **Be Honest but Kind**: Don't overpraise. If the work is missing or incorrect, point it out clearly, but respectfully.\n\n    Return your review in **valid JSON format** like this:\n    {\n      \"score\": <integer between 0\u2013100>,\n      \"feedback\": \"<clear, supportive feedback with suggestions>\"\n    }\n\n    Here's the student's submitted code:\n\n    ```python\n    \n    ```\n    ",

Please ensure that you include your code and any relevant comments or explanations for your assignment. Remember to implement data preprocessing, construct and evaluate the ANN and CNN models, and compare their performances as outlined in the assignment. Once you have added your work, I would be happy to review it!\"\n}"
